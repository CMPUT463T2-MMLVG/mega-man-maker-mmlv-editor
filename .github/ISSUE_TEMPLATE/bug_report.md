<!-- READ THIS FIRST BEFORE REPORTING BUGS!!
The golden rule is to always open one issue for one bug. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them. It's also good practice to search first in the issue tracker before reporting your issue. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to open a new issue. The bugsquad will handle it from there if it's a duplicate.

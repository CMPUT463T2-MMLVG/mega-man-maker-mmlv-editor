# mega-man-maker-level-editor
Mega Man Maker MMLV Editor is a work-in-progress interactive program. It allows to create and modify level in the game that can bypass the limitations like autotile, zero timer Count Bomb, custom boss portrait, level settings, and more.

# Installation

```git
git clone https://github.com/Firstject/mega-man-maker-mmlv-editor.git
```

Currently the program is not ready for editing. However, you can try playing around with the code by downloading [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) and open this project.

# Future

The final version will be a completed program with fully functional level editor.

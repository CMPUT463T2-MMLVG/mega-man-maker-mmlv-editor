# About

Nowadays, text-editing level is becoming more frequent and tedious process which led to time-consuming. There are users which do not wish to create level provided by the limitations of the gameplay itself.

This editor allows a level file (.mmlv) to be modified or a new level to be created visually. The tilesets, objects, ladders, spikes, backgrounds, active screens, and level properties can be edited manually which gives the user more control over the limitations.

Below is a list of possibilities what can be edited and saved (from what we have tested):
- Tilemap
- Game objects
- Ladders
- Spikes
  - _Mega Man Maker will change the spike direction in the editor automatically, but not when directly playtesting the level._
- Level properties
- Screen connections
  - _Still tedious to edit_

First of all, thank you for trying out the source code. This seems to be your first time on the project, so let's get started by opening a scene 'Level.tscn' (can be found in the directory \"res://src/scenes/level/level.tscn\").

As a reminder, make a backup of your level first before saving the level! There is no insurance here, so if anything wrong happened to your level, we have no responsibility to recover your level file.

Hang on a moment so you can close this window after (Re)importing assets process is finished..."
